Pascaline, the second of five siblings, grew up in Kibera's Laini Saba amid financial hardships. Viola Davis aptly described her family as "po!" â€” where poor was a step higher than po. 

Attending Laini Saba Primary School, Pascaline's life took a positive turn when Miss Moore, facilitated by the Sacred Heart sisters, covered her school fees, provided uniforms, and books, making her school days bearable. 

Remarkably, all her siblings secured scholarships. Through the generosity of others, Pascaline and her siblings received a quality education. Now, as a professional baker and Advocate of the High Court of Kenya, she pays it forward through Elpida, ensuring another child can access education and brighter days ahead. 

Grateful for Miss. Moore's anonymous support and the unwavering love and support of her Father, George Dittmar, Pascaline embraces her journey from adversity to professional success.
