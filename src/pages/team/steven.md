Stephen Juma hails from a humble background and was born and currently resides in Kibera, recognized as the largest slum in the world. 

He completed both his primary and secondary education in Kibera, gaining firsthand insight into the challenges faced by parents and children striving to meet their essential needs and pursue education. 

Having lived in Kibera for over 30 years, he is motivated by his educational achievements and aspire to extend this opportunity to the less fortunate. He aims to help them reach their goals through education, and believes this can be accomplished through Elpida Trust Foundation.
